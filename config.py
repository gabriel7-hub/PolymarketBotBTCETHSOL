# 1-tick adverse-fill stress — but PF is below the 1.5 live-capital gate, AND the backtest
# could not model the order-book depth-walk (recorded ticks are top-of-book only). So we run
# it as an ISOLATED PAPER SHADOW first: it reads the already-computed signal, records its own
# leg='CERTAINTY' ledger rows, never opens a real position, never touches the risk guard, and
# is hard-gated to paper in main.py. The point is to capture DEPTH-REALISTIC fills via the live

# data (recovered.db, 1,124 resolved shadows since Jun-22 09:00 ET, realistic +1-tick fill):
#   SOL+XRP : PF 1.72 / win 93.0% / EV $1.29   (CLEARS the 1.5 live gate)
#   BTC+ETH : PF 1.06 / win 88.7% / EV ~0       (carries adverse-selection risk for no edge)
# So the leg only fires on the assets below; BTC/ETH still trade/record everything else but skip
# the certainty shadow. Revisit if BTC/ETH accumulate a PF>=1.5 sample. Validated 2026-06-24.
# 2026-06-28: GATED TO SOL — the only asset with a survivorship-free edge. Three independent lines
# of evidence converge: (1) post-22 backtest realistic fills SOL +$100/PF 1.12 vs BTC −$303/ETH −$317;
# (2) BTC/ETH stay NEGATIVE even at perfect "touch" fills (latency/London cannot rescue them);
# (3) apples-to-apples reconciliation of the live dashboard vs backtest — the live +P&L on BTC/ETH/XRP
# was SURVIVORSHIP (bot traded 622/1206 windows @ 92.4% vs the true 86.7% pop = −$637), only SOL was
# positive in BOTH. XRP is marginal (backtest ~breakeven, live +$206 was a 97.7%/86-trade streak) — it
# can be re-added if it clears on London-tightened fills. NOTE: this gates only the certainty SHADOW;
# `_record_tick` still records ticks for ALL config.ASSETS, so the BTC/ETH/XRP London A/B backtest is
# fully preserved. See memory dashboard-pnl-survivorship-bias / certainty-asset-gate-sol-xrp.

# REFINED 2026-06-28: a fine sub-floor sweep (analyze_barbell, full DB, cert leg) found the real edge
# CLIFF is at 0.78, not 0.82 — the old floor over-corrected and discarded a profitable band:
#   0.70-0.78 : 67-74% win, net edge -3 to -6  → -$142  (model overconfidence — STILL excluded)
#   0.78-0.80 : 86.8% win,  net edge +7.0      → +$74
#   0.80-0.82 : 87.2% win,  net edge +5.3      → +$25
# Realized win% AT a given book ask is a market property (book underprices favorites here, 87% vs
# ~79% breakeven), so it is more model-independent / robust than the rejected barbell. Hence floor
# lowered to 0.78. CAVEAT: the 0.78-0.82 sample is modest (77 trades, mostly pre-recal; n=22 post-recal
# @ 90.9%/+$21) — monitor with `analyze_barbell.py --leg CERT_LIVE` and raise back if it regresses.
# Do NOT go below 0.78: sub-0.78 is the validated bleed zone. (A model-vs-book gap CAP was separately
# tried and REJECTED, PF→0.85.) Bonus: cheaper entries also shrink the "1 loss eats N wins" ratio.
# REJECTED by the same validation: a model-vs-book gap CAP (hurt, PF→0.85) and firing only in
# the last ≤45s (non-monotonic; ≤45s was net-negative here, unlike the older 8,044-window DB).

# Hypothesis from 733 REAL on-chain trades (J27+J28, data-api /activity, resolved via Gamma):
# entry win% vs breakeven looked like a BARBELL — edge in 0.78-0.85 and 0.91-0.97, with the
# 0.85-0.91 "murky middle" a fee-funded NET LOSER (-$13). It did NOT replicate: analyze_barbell.py
# on the full DB (4,191 cert trades) shows 0.85-0.91 is solidly POSITIVE (net_edge +3.6 / +2.3pts,
# +$1,572) and the curve is ~monotonic — the only band that loses in BOTH samples is the <0.78
# longshot tail, which CERTAINTY_MIN_ASK=0.82 already excludes. Skipping the middle would DELETE
# edge. So the gate stays OFF. The 2-day barbell was small-sample noise (~1 SE per bucket) — a
# textbook reminder to validate on the larger sample before acting. Re-enable only if a large,
# bias-free REAL sample reproduces it (check with analyze_barbell.py). See longshot-tail-miscalibration.

# ─── Cross-asset CORRELATION guard (2026-06-28) ───────────────────────────────────────────
# The 4 assets move together, so N simultaneous same-direction certainty bets in one 5-min window
# are really ONE bet at N× size — fake diversification. Measured (4,191 cert trades): windows where
# >=2 assets lost together = 44% of ALL loss dollars; 4 windows lost all four; worst window -$102.
#
# Design = COMBINED STAKE CAP (not a count cap): bound the TOTAL same-side live certainty stake per
# window to CERTAINTY_CORR_STAKE_USDC, split equally across the live universe. Each firing asset
# requests its fair share (budget / #live-assets), capped at its base size; the guard grants up to
# the remaining budget. This keeps BREADTH — when all 4 agree and WIN, you still win all 4 (smaller
# size each) instead of forgoing the 3rd/4th (which historically win 92.4%) — while an all-4-LOSS is
# bounded to the budget. With SOL-only live (1 asset) the share = full budget, capped at base, so it
# is a NO-OP today; it only reshapes sizing once CERTAINTY_LIVE_ASSETS widens. Trade-off: in a
# multi-asset-live regime a window where only ONE asset fires is sized at its fair share, not full
# base (conservative under-bet on uncorrelated windows — tune the budget when you go multi-live).
# Only the LIVE order path is constrained; paper shadows still record every fire for analysis.
# Budget = $4 with 4 live assets ⇒ $1 each (the Polymarket minimum) when all 4 agree, total $4/window
# same-side; all-4 WIN takes all four, all-4 LOSS bounded to -$4. A share that would round below
# CERTAINTY_MIN_ORDER_USDC is not placed live (→ paper) — so keep budget ≥ #live × $1.

# ─── Maker-first entry (PAPER) — the execution lever ────────────────────────────────────
# 2026-06-28. Measured finding (recovered.db, 1,665 trades): the certainty leg's P&L is almost
# entirely a function of FILL price, not signal — taker (+1 adverse tick) = −$693 / PF 0.87, while
# a maker fill (−1 tick) = +$213 / PF 1.04 (each 1c of fill ≈ $453 / ~$0.27/trade). The +$213 is an
# UPPER BOUND, though: a resting limit fills only when the book trades through it — which is
# disproportionately when the favorite is WEAKENING (adverse selection — retired thesis #1). So this
# models the REALISTIC recoverable middle: when the gate fires we POST a limit at ask − OFFSET ticks
# for WAIT secs; it fills (as a MAKER, fee=0) ONLY if the live book actually trades down to our price
# within the window; otherwise we CROSS and take at the current ask + 1 tick (today's behavior). The
# adverse-selection bias is captured, not assumed away. PAPER-only; live entry path is unchanged.
# 2026-06-28: DISABLED. The realistic offline test landed at −$705 ≈ pure taker (only 22% fill as
# maker, and those are the losers: PF 0.84). It does not recover P&L AND it muddies the clean
# before/after taker-fill measurement we need for the London migration. Keep it as a pure TAKER
# baseline so the London latency improvement (tighter taker fills) is cleanly attributable. Code is
# retained; flip back to True only to re-measure the maker path. See maker-first-adverse-selection.
